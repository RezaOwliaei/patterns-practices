* **Design Principles**  
  * "Tell, Don't Ask" Principle: Guideline promoting encapsulation.  
  * "Always Valid" Pattern/Principle: Ensuring objects always maintain a valid state.  
  * Encapsulation: Bundling data with methods that operate on it.  
  * Object Invariants: Rules that must always hold true for an object.  
  * Principle of Least Astonishment: Behavior of a component should be obvious and predictable.  
  * Exhaustiveness Principle: Ensuring all possible cases, conditions, or required behaviors are explicitly addressed and handled by the design.  
* **Design Patterns**  
  * Value Object (VO) Pattern: Immutable objects defined by their value.  
  * "Guardian" (Invariant Protection): An entity (like an Aggregate Root) that enforces rules.  
* **Idioms/Concepts**  
  * "Polite Object" (Idiom): A well-behaved object that adheres to good OOP principles.  
  * Pit of Success (Idiom): A system designed to make the right way the easiest way to code.  
* **Anti-Patterns**  
  * Primitive Obsession (Anti-Pattern): Misuse of simple primitives instead of rich objects.
