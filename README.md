# Software Design Principles and Patterns

This repository is a collection of software design principles and patterns, explained in a simple and practical way. The goal is to provide a quick reference for developers to understand and apply these concepts in their daily work.

Each principle or pattern has its own document with a detailed explanation, examples, and use cases.
